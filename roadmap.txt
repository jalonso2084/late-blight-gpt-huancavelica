## 🔄 Planned Refinements (v1.2+)

### 1. Modifier Logic Refinement
- Expand “compound modifier” logic for borderline risk cases (e.g., marginal humidity + high elevation + no fungicide).
- Explore a scoring matrix to help future maintainers assess interaction weights.

### 2. Structured Input Templates
- Provide prompt templates in both web and SMS contexts.
- Add these examples to onboarding and user documentation to reduce input ambiguity.

### 3. Confidence Scoring Enhancements
- Extend confidence-lowering triggers (e.g., conflicting RH/temp, missing variety).
- Develop macros to flag unusual seasonal combinations (e.g., RH > 90% with very low temperature).

### 4. Outbreak Pattern Referencing
- Train GPT to cite specific outbreak patterns from `calibration_history.md` when matching conditions arise.
- e.g., “This matches the 2020 Lircay outbreak (RH >85%, 17°C, no fungicide)”

### 5. User Feedback Loop Integration
- Encourage users to rate outputs (e.g., `/rate_recommendation Good/Bad`)
- Include optional feedback text: “What made this advice helpful/unhelpful?”
- Plan lightweight backend to collect anonymized insights for retraining or rule calibration
