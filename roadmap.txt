# 🗺️ Roadmap: Late Blight Risk Advisor GPT

This roadmap outlines current capabilities and future directions for improving agronomic advice and hybrid AI functionality.

---

## ✅ Current Functionality (v1.1)

- Rule-based late blight risk assessment (Low / Moderate / High)
- Regional varietal logic (e.g., Amarilis more susceptible in Central Andes)
- Humidity + temperature + fungicide interaction logic
- Confidence scoring system (High / Low)
- Benchmark-guided examples for prompt alignment
- Transparent calibration with known outbreak patterns (2018–2024)

---

## 🔜 Planned Features

### 📡 1. LoRA Hybrid Integration
- Add `/run_lora_check` route to cross-validate GPT risk estimate with LoRA model
- If outputs disagree, return “conflict” flag to user
- Helps uncover blind spots in either system

### 🧾 2. Calibration Reporting
- Add option for users to request calibration context:
  > “This resembles the 2020 Lircay outbreak”
- Backed by calibration_history.md

### 📲 3. SMS/USSD Fallback (Offline Mode)
- Encode query as: `RH85/48h T17 Var:Yungay`
- Return risk level + one-line explanation
- Partner with field trial networks for testing

### 📈 4. Feedback Loop
- Ask users: “Was this advice helpful?”
- Store optional responses with metadata (location, conditions)
- Enables future semi-supervised learning

### 🔒 5. Privacy & Consent
- Add disclosure to README and SMS prompts:
  > “Your inputs may be stored anonymously to improve recommendations.”
