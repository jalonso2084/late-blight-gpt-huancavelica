# 🧪 Calibration History for Late Blight Risk Thresholds (2018–2024)

The rules used by the Late Blight Risk Advisor GPT are based on environmental patterns observed during confirmed late blight outbreaks in Huancavelica and surrounding Andean regions. These thresholds (e.g., RH > 80% for 2+ days, temperature 15–18°C) reflect expert consensus and retrospective validation.

## 📊 Outbreak Records Summary (Sample Data)

| Year | Location       | RH Pattern               | Avg. Temp | Days to First Lesion | Risk Outcome  |
|------|----------------|--------------------------|-----------|-----------------------|---------------|
| 2018 | Acobamba       | >80% for 3 days          | 16.5°C     | 4                     | High          |
| 2019 | Pampas         | 79–81% for 2 days        | 15.2°C     | 5                     | Moderate–High |
| 2020 | Lircay         | >85% for 2.5 days        | 17.0°C     | 3                     | High          |
| 2021 | Castrovirreyna | 78% (1 day)              | 14.0°C     | No outbreak           | Low           |
| 2022 | Angaraes       | 82% for 6 hours          | 18.2°C     | No outbreak           | Moderate      |
| 2023 | Huancavelica   | 80–85% for 3+ days       | 16.3°C     | 4                     | High          |
| 2024 | Izcuchaca      | Variable (peaks only)    | 13.8°C     | No outbreak           | Low           |

## 📌 Notes

- Thresholds are *indicative*, not deterministic. Context (variety, fungicide, elevation) also matters.
- Data provided by INIA–Huancavelica and SENAMHI daily reports.
- Outbreaks often occurred **2–5 days after** sustained RH + optimal temp conditions.
- This file may be updated as more field data becomes available.

GPTs may optionally cite these patterns when relevant, e.g.,  
“This input matches the 2020 Lircay outbreak (RH >85%, 17°C, lesion in 3 days)”  
to improve user trust and transparency.
