# Building Custom GPTs for Agriculture – Case Study: The Late Blight Risk Advisor
**By Jorge Luis Alonso with ChatGPT-4o**

## 1. Introduction: Why Custom AI Tools Matter in Agriculture
What if farmers could ask an intelligent assistant about the risk of plant disease — and get answers based on weather, crop type, and science?

Now they can. With custom GPTs — AI tools trained for specific tasks like farming — this is no longer just an idea. These assistants don't need large systems or expert users. With the right data and advice, they can help farmers make real decisions in the field.

This article shows how to build one using low-cost, easy-to-use AI. It looks at a real-world example: the Late Blight Risk Advisor — Huancavelica.

## 2. What is a GPT? A Simple Explanation for Non-Experts
GPT stands for **Generative Pretrained Transformer**.

It's like a smart assistant that has read millions of texts. It learns how we use language to answer questions or complete tasks. It is powerful because you can train it to focus on a topic — like the risk of late blight in potatoes — by giving it clear rules, examples, and instructions.

## 3. Why Customised GPTs Are Important in Low-Resource Farming Contexts
In rural areas like Huancavelica, Peru, farmers often lack nearby agronomic experts, climate-risk tools, and reliable internet.

The **Late Blight Risk Advisor – Huancavelica**, a custom GPT developed specifically for the Huancavelica region of Peru, follows a simple, technician-led process designed for these environments:

**Step 1: Collect information (offline)**  
A technician talks to the farmer — by visit, phone, or SMS — to gather key details: location, crop type, recent weather, and fungicide use. No internet connection is needed.

**Step 2: Enter data (online)**  
If the technician has internet access, they enter the data into the GPT. The assistant returns a risk assessment with clear reasoning and advice.

**Step 3: Save advice**  
The output is saved — by copy and paste, screenshot, or a simple tool — for offline use.

**Step 4: Share results (offline)**  
Back on the farm, the technician displays the stored advice. No internet is required.

This allows one technician to support many farmers. To keep the advice fresh — especially for weather — the answers are updated daily where possible and are valid for about 24 hours.

The advice is simple and bilingual. Technicians are trained to guide farmers in providing accurate information — for example, estimating humidity levels if the farmer is unsure.

**Workflow overview:**  
Farmer observes field → Technician collects information (offline) → Technician inputs into GPT (online) → Saves response → Shares advice (offline)

## 4. What It Takes to Build an Agricultural GPT
Development costs were low, mostly related to the time spent organising the data and reviewing it with experts. This project used **OpenAI's GPT Builder** — an affordable tool for small custom setups. While the model itself isn't open source, the **rules, examples, and prompts** that guide it are openly shared so that others can reuse them.

To build a useful GPT for agriculture, you need two things: **structured knowledge** and **clear examples**.

**Core agronomic data inputs:**
- Environmental indicators: temperature, humidity, rainfall (historical and current)
- Crop-specific attributes: variety planted, planting dates, typical growth stages
- Disease patterns: known outbreak triggers, risk thresholds
- Field heuristics: agronomist rules (e.g., high humidity + 18°C → high risk)

**Supporting knowledge resources:**
- Published scientific literature and extension manuals
- Region-specific variety resistance guides
- Expert-validated agronomic rulesets
- Documented local practices (e.g., debris removal, chaqru mixtures, highland rotations)

This knowledge was added through tutorials and key reference files in OpenAI's GPT Builder. Where real data was lacking, local agronomists helped to verify invented examples. The GPT also prompts users to confirm extreme values (such as above 100% humidity or below 0°C) before proceeding.
