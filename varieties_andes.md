# ðŸ§¬ Varietal Susceptibility to Late Blight in the Peruvian Andes

_Last updated: 2025-05-01_

This file summarizes how key potato varieties behave under late blight pressure, with a focus on resistance levels by region. These insights are based on Peruvian field trials, participatory selection, and climate adaptation research.

## ðŸ”¹ Resistance Classification

| Resistance Level | Description                                          |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **High**         | Demonstrates strong resistance under most conditions |
| **Moderate**     | Tolerates some pressure, risk increases with stress  |
| **Low**          | Easily infected under typical humidity conditions    |

## ðŸ”¹ Key Varieties

### 1. **Amarilis**
- **North**: Moderate to High resistance
- **Central/South (e.g., Huancavelica, Ayacucho)**: Moderate to Low resistance
- **Notes**: Performs poorly under prolonged humidity (>80%) in highland zones with persistent fog/cloud.

### 2. **Yungay**
- **All regions**: Low resistance
- **Notes**: Susceptible to both early and late infection stages. Requires fungicide protection in all conditions.

### 3. **CanchÃ¡n**
- **All regions**: Moderate resistance
- **Notes**: Balanced performance but sensitive to poor drainage or extended canopy wetness.

### 4. **UNICA**
- **All regions**: High resistance
- **Notes**: Developed for durable late blight resistance and climate resilience in Andean farming systems.

### 5. **INIA 303 - Kawsay**
- **All regions**: High resistance
- **Notes**: Recently released. Strong resilience to Phytophthora infestans and temperature variation.

## ðŸ”¹ Regional Modifiers

- Resistance varies not only by genetics but by **elevation, slope, fog exposure**, and local microclimates.
- Varieties like **Amarilis** may behave as resistant in northern zones but become vulnerable in southern highland valleys with longer wet cycles.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Usage in Risk Assessment

- **Low-resistance varieties** elevate the assessed risk level by one class if baseline is Low or borderline Moderate.
- **High-resistance varieties** may neutralize a Moderate risk down to Low if other conditions are marginal.
- When in doubt, apply **"highest risk wins"** logic if varietal weakness coincides with wet, warm patterns.
