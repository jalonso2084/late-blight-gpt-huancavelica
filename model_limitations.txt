# 📉 Model Limitations: LoRA-Fine-Tuned OpenLLaMA 3B

_Last updated: 2025-05-01_

This document summarizes the known limitations of the LoRA-fine-tuned OpenLLaMA 3B model (v5) for assessing potato late blight risk in Huancavelica, Peru. It provides context for why a rule-based GPT assistant was developed in parallel.

## 🔻 1. Moderate-Risk Blind Spot
- Frequently misclassified “Moderado” cases as either Low or High.
- F1-score for Moderate class was low (0.25).
- Lacked nuanced temporal awareness for transitional weather patterns.

## 🔺 2. Overprediction of High Risk
- Fine-tuning with more “Alto” samples boosted recall (1.00), but increased false positives.
- May lead to overuse of fungicides in borderline conditions.

## 🔸 3. Overreliance on Single Variables
- Sometimes flagged risk due to a short humidity spike without considering duration or varietal modifiers.

## 🔸 4. Small Evaluation Set
- Accuracy (73%) was based on a 10-sample test set.
- High performance on “Alto” may reflect overfitting or chance.

## 🔸 5. Prompt Sensitivity
- Outputs varied significantly with small changes in prompt phrasing.
- Performance degraded on unstructured or implicit inputs.

## 🔸 6. No Built-in Temporal Memory
- Could not track multi-day weather trends unless explicitly described in the prompt.
- Required phrasing like “humidity >80% for 2 days” to trigger proper classification.

## 🔸 7. Fragile Training Environment
- Required float32 casting post-LoRA application to avoid NaN losses.
- Incompatible with some notebooks and bit-quantization setups unless carefully managed.

## ✅ Strategic Complementarity with GPT

The rule-based GPT addresses these gaps by:
- Applying validated heuristics consistently
- Interpreting unstructured inputs more robustly
- Avoiding GPU inference requirements
- Explaining each decision with citations

Planned Feature:
- A `/run_lora_check` command will allow side-by-side comparison between GPT logic and LoRA predictions.
- Disagreements will be flagged for expert review and may help refine future training.

## 🧪 Testing Outlook

Both systems can be used in parallel:
- GPT: primary decision tool in low-resource settings
- LoRA: statistical cross-check in more structured, supervised deployments

Field trials and extension worker feedback will help determine the optimal balance between the two.
